# About Me

My name is ArmaÄŸan Karatosun and I am a PhD student at Istanbul Technical University. In addition to that, I work as a System Administrator at Turkish Economy Bank (entity of BNP Paribas). My key values are;

* I believe learning is a lifelong endeavor. I have strong ability to learn on my own and take in new information and ideas.
* I am willing to attend and/or speak at industry conferences and share my knowledge with others.
* I am not a lone wolf. I can be a good communicator who plays well with others.
* I believe in DevOps. I aim to release quality software rapidly and repeatedly.
* I try to be a problem solver and embrace "can-do" attitude.
