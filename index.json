[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Introduction and Requirements In this article, we will learn how to host multiple virtual websites with Apache on Ubuntu 16.04. I am assuming that you already have Apache server up and running but if you don\u0026rsquo;t, just run sudo apt-get install apache2 to install it on Ubuntu. A running Apache web server is all you need for this tutorial, but if you want actually build something in it (i.e, a nice website), then you might want to check out \u0026ldquo;LAMP stack\u0026rdquo; on Google. I also have an Ansible playbook for installing LAMP stack and can be seen in here. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s get down to business!\n1) Create Vhost Configuration file for Apache In order to host your website (in local or not), you have to create configuration files for Apache in related directories. To do that, create a file with the name you desired, example1.com.conf in this example, in /etc/apache2/sites-available and add the following lines;\n\u0026lt;VirtualHost *:80\u0026gt; ServerAdmin root@localhost ServerName example1.localhost DocumentRoot \u0026quot;/home/$USER/Desktop/example1.com/public_html\u0026quot; \u0026lt;Directory \u0026quot;/home/$USER/Desktop/example1.com/public_html\u0026quot;\u0026gt; Order allow,deny Require all granted Allow from 127.0.0.1 AllowOverride All \u0026lt;/Directory\u0026gt; ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/example1.com_error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/example1.com_access.log combined \u0026lt;/VirtualHost\u0026gt;  In here,\n ServerAdmin = contact info of the admin. ServerName = name of your locally hosted website. DocumentRoot = is the root directory for your webiste. Directory = is used to enclose a group of directives that will apply. ErrorLog = is where error logs are stored. CustomLog = is where access logs are stored. $USER = is your username, change it with your actual username.  You can modify this configuration file as you wish, but just make sure that the file is owned by the root user and group.\n2) Make Your Site Available with a2ensite We have to copy our new configuration file to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled directory to enable it but in Apache, we have tool for that called a2ensite. While you making your site available with a2ensite, you might want to disable default Apache web page and configuration with a2dissite and reload the Apache configuration. So in summary;\n sudo a2ensite example1.com.conf to enable your site. Disable default Apache web page and configuration with sudo a2dissite 000-default sudo service apache2 reload (or sudo systemctl reload apache2.service) to reload Apache Web Server\n  to proceed.\n3) Edit Your /etc/hosts File To view your website in your favorite web browser, just edit your /etc/hosts file and add example1.localhost in it. After that, just create an helloworld file as your index (for example; index.html) in your website directory, open your browser and go to http://example1.localhost. You should see the helloworld page that you created.\nExample /etc/hosts file;\n127.0.0.1\tlocalhost 127.0.0.1 example1.localhost  Example helloworld index.html file;\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header\u0026gt;\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;This is title\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; Hello world \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  And you are ready to go! Just repeat these steps to host multiple local websites with Apache.\n","date":1537123020,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537123020,"objectID":"58ac8deceaaef063b911274bc1e2cfe9","permalink":"https://armagankaratosun.github.io/post/2019-09-16-setup-local-site-in-apache-on-ubuntu/","publishdate":"2018-09-16T21:37:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-09-16-setup-local-site-in-apache-on-ubuntu/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction and Requirements In this article, we will learn how to host multiple virtual websites with Apache on Ubuntu 16.04.

While both of them are very good and solid in Linux, Plesk is the only option when it comes to Windows, so one may have to use both tools to manage his/her hosting servers. Using two different tools on two different platforms (Windows and Linux) requires different bits of knowledge and sometimes, more resources. Centralized DNS is a good idea when it comes to optimizing the resources and reduce the management overhead. With Centralized DNS, you can be able to use a single set of name servers for all of the domains you host on your servers. Lucky for you, both cPanel and Plesk supports Centralized DNS but with different approaches. I, as many of the others, use Plesk for my Windows hosting platforms while using cPanel on Linux. cPanel DNSONLY is a good tool for Centralized DNS and It is easy to use and deploy. Plesk Windows, on the other hand, comes with Windows DNS and DNS Slave Extension can be used for Centralized DNS. Combining the two, on the other hand, is possible (in theory) but requires some tweaks on both sides. But using one master node to rule them all (see what I did there?) is a huge gain, so in this post, we will learn how to BIND them.\nInstall Plesk DNS Slave Extension Installing Plesk DNS Slave Extension is very straightforward and easy with using the Extensions Catalog in the Plesk UI. Just click Extensions in the side menu and search for the Slave DNS Manager and click install. After the installation has finished, click Go to Extension button to add DNS slaves.\nSetting Up Slave DNS Servers cPanel DNSONLY installation contains three simple steps wich can be summerized as;\n1) Go to home directory;\ncd /home  2) Download installation script;\ncurl -o latest-dnsonly -L https://securedownloads.cpanel.net/latest-dnsonly  3) Execute;\nsh latest-dnsonly  The installation process can fail if your operating system is using NetworkManager so you might want to disable NetworkManager and use network service instead. Check out this link for more information; How to disable NetworkManager on CentOS / RHEL 7\nAdding DNS Slaves After the installation, one can easily add DNS slaves to the system with few simple steps;\n1) Enter Slave DNS address\n2) Change Secret key with your own secret on your cPanel DNS server\nmore /etc/rndc.key  3) Save your old named.conf as named.conf.old, create new config file on your cPanel DNSONLY server and add required lines;\nmv /etc/named.conf /etc/named.conf.old vi /etc/named.conf  and add required lines. Your named.conf should look like this;\ninclude \u0026quot;/etc/rndc.key\u0026quot;; controls { inet * port 953 allow { YOUR PLESK SERVER IP; 127.0.0.1;} keys { \u0026quot;rndc-key\u0026quot;; }; }; acl trusted { YOUR PLESK SERVER IP; DNSONLY IP; }; options { listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; YOUR PLESK SERVER IP; }; listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; }; directory \u0026quot;/var/named\u0026quot;; dump-file \u0026quot;/var/named/data/cache_dump.db\u0026quot;; statistics-file \u0026quot;/var/named/data/named_stats.txt\u0026quot;; memstatistics-file \u0026quot;/var/named/data/named_mem_stats.txt\u0026quot;; allow-new-zones yes; allow-transfer { YOUR PLESK SERVER IP; }; masterfile-format text; recursion no; dnssec-enable yes; dnssec-validation yes; /* Path to ISC DLV key */ bindkeys-file \u0026quot;/etc/named.iscdlv.key\u0026quot;; managed-keys-directory \u0026quot;/var/named/dynamic\u0026quot;; pid-file \u0026quot;/run/named/named.pid\u0026quot;; session-keyfile \u0026quot;/run/named/session.key\u0026quot;; }; logging { channel default_debug { file \u0026quot;data/named.run\u0026quot;; severity dynamic; }; }; zone \u0026quot;.\u0026quot; IN { type hint; file \u0026quot;named.ca\u0026quot;; }; include \u0026quot;/etc/named.rfc1912.zones\u0026quot;; include \u0026quot;/etc/named.root.key\u0026quot;;  and restart your BIND using;\nservice named restart  4) Click OK to continue.\nChange Windows DNS to BIND on Plesk Default Plesk installation comes with Windows DNS but we have to switch it to BIND in order to integrate it with cPanel DNSONLY. To do this;\n Go to Tools \u0026amp; Settings \u0026gt; Updates and Upgrades and install the BIND DNS server using the Plesk Installer. Go to Tools \u0026amp; Settings \u0026gt; Server Components and click DNS Server. Select BIND DNS Server and click OK.  Exterminate the Bug on Plesk Windows Plesk Windows comes with a bug which causes DNS zones served by Bind DNS server on Windows are not synced with the slave DNS. As a workaround;\n Connect to the server via RDP Create Plesk database backup (optional) Add fallowing line into Plesk Database Manually  plesk db \u0026quot;REPLACE INTO misc VALUES ('DNS_Allow_Transfer0', 'YOUR SLAVE IP');\u0026quot;  You can find more information about this bug in here; Zones are not transferred from Bind on Windows .\nEnjoy Your New Centralized DNS Setup Your Centralized DNS setup is ready to go, but you might want to correct one more thing if you want to use your new setup with cPanel DNS Clusters. cPanel stores DNS records in domain.ltd.db format instead of domain.ltd and this causes malfunctions (read as DNS clusters are not syncing) on DNS Cluster setup. In order to overcome this, rename your DNS records as domain.ltd.db and manually push your records on your master cPanel DNS ONLY server with;\n/scripts/dnscluster syncall --full  you can also automate this process with simple script added on cron jobs. And that\u0026rsquo;s it! Enjoy your new centralized DNS setup with Plesk DNS Slave Manager and cPanel DNSONLY!\n","date":1526450460,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526450460,"objectID":"0d20a603d9791c5086bc8deed69cbd19","permalink":"https://armagankaratosun.github.io/post/2018-05-16-plesk-windows-with-cpanel-dnsonly/","publishdate":"2018-05-16T09:01:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-05-16-plesk-windows-with-cpanel-dnsonly/","section":"post","summary":"How to use Plesk Slave DNS Manager with cPanel DNSONLY Plesk and cPanel are the main tools for hosting platforms nowadays.
